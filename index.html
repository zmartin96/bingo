    <h3>Zach's All-American Bingo!</h3>
    <p>
        People say that the 2024 election wasn't about policies, but that doesn't mean that it won't have an effect on the
        policies that are implemented in the next four years. I have spent the past year and a half sifting through policy
        proposals from <i>Project 2025</i> (yes, I hate
        myself). Now that the Republicans have admitted that <i>Project 2025</i> was the plan all along and that they were
        simply
        lying about not planning to implement it, I have compiled a list of policies that are proposed and planned to be
        instated. I have created a bingo card generator to help keep track of all the exciting new policies that are in
        store. If we are going to lose our rights, we might as well have fun doing it.
